"""Turn-taking metric using ElevenLabs audio timestamps (no LLM judge).

Per-turn scores are continuous in [0, 1]. For each turn we use the signal that actually
characterizes what happened on that turn:
  - turn ∈ assistant_interrupted_turns → overlap-based score (capped)
  - turn ∈ user_interrupted_turns      → agent-yield-based score
  - turn ∈ both sets                   → min of the two above
  - otherwise                          → latency-based score

Main turn_taking.score = mean(per-turn scores).

Flat headline sub-metrics (one number each — show up as columns in analysis views):
  Latency:              mean_latency_ms, p50_latency_ms, p90_latency_ms,
                        on_time_rate, early_rate, late_rate
  Agent interruptions:  agent_interruption.rate (always),
                        agent_interruption.mean_overlap_ms,
                        agent_interruption.mean_overlap_score,
                        agent_interruption.mean_post_interrupt_latency_ms,
                        agent_interruption.mean_post_interrupt_latency_score
                        (all except rate only when rate > 0; the post_interrupt_*
                        pair is additionally gated on at least one interrupt turn
                        having a settled agent response afterward)
  User interruptions:   user_interruption.rate (always),
                        user_interruption.mean_yield_ms,
                        user_interruption.mean_yield_score
                        (the latter two only when rate > 0)

All reported sub-metrics are consistent with the main score: the ``mean_overlap_score``
and ``mean_yield_score`` aggregate exactly the per-turn scores that feed into
``turn_taking.score``. No separate binary "recovered" / "yielded" classifications are
computed (the continuous curves already capture gradation).

Per-turn context (overlap/yield/latency ms, derived scores, and diagnostic
n_interrupt_segments) is preserved in the main metric's details.per_turn_evidence.
